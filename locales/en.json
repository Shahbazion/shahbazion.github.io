  "home.welcome": "Hello! I am Saeed AliShahbazi.",
  "home.description": "I am a backend & frontend developer focusing on JavaScript, Node.js, and Python. For me, programming goes beyond writing code; it’s about creating precise, maintainable, and reliable solutions for real-world challenges.\n\nI have always prioritized writing clean, structured, and well-documented code. I use Git and GitHub professionally, committing meaningful changes and maintaining organized branches.\n\nI design systems that are scalable, maintainable, and understandable. My skills include API development, database management, and professional documentation.\n\nMy goal is to migrate and establish work residency abroad, seeking a professional environment where I can grow and pursue innovative opportunities.\n\nI value collaborations based on quality, transparency, and mutual respect.",
